# Gauntlet of Thyrion
Gauntlet of Thyrion is a fork of the UHexen2 SDL2 fork (Hammer of Thyrion fork) but focuses exclusively on being a great singleplayer macOS port, nothing more.

Being singleplayer focused, I am not bothered about hexenworld or any server stuff, this is purely the singleplayer game.

# Building

To build, go into the 'engine/hexen2' directory and inside there will be a 'MacOSX' directory, open the xcode project contained and build.  All universal dependencies are included.

# Playing

First you will need the Hexen 2 data (buy it from the affiliate link over at MacSourcePorts) and do the following:

1. Copy the data1, help, music and splash directories to /Users/<your user>/Library/Application Support/ Hexen2
2. Execute the app bundle (gl or software) and kick butt!
